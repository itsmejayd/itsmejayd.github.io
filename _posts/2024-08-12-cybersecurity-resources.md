This page is basically a directory of links.<!--more--> I have a hodgepodge of useful bookmarks accumulated over time in a yet-to-be-well-organized bookmark directory and I wanted to group up a few of them for specific topics (this page being for links related to some basic cybersec/infosec/netsec/opsec stuff). I figured I might as well post it here for my own reference and so others might get use from it! These links are in no particular order, though Iâ€™ll try to provide a brief description of what each one is here.

I might add a table of contents for these link dump pages at a later date because some of them are pretty long... but for now if anyone is reading this, command/crtl+f will have to suffice.

# Cyber Threat Maps:
## What is a cyber threat map?
* 'Cyberattack maps, also called cyber threat maps, are visual representations of real-time or historical cyberattacks on networks, devices and computer systems...Cyberattack maps leverage data analysis and visualization tools to provide insights into the nature and scope of cyber threats, such as:
    * Location
    * Frequency
    * Attack type
* Some visualization techniques include heat maps, graphs and timelines so that users understand the information more easily.'
([paraphrased from splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/cyberattack-maps.html))

## [Check Point Cyber Threat Map](https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/)
* Provides a real-time visualization of cyberattacks worldwide.
* Displays data on the sources and targets of attacks, showing the volume and types of threats detected.
* The map is dynamic, with attacks represented as lines connecting the origin to the destination, providing insight into global cyber threat patterns.

## [Digital Attack Map (depricated)](https://www.digitalattackmap.com)
* This one *was* my favorite, but it seems the site hasn't been updating since 2021. Still interesting to check it out to see the design and sources/methods of a cool threat map dashboard. Also useful for historical attack data analysis.

# Miscellaneous Tools (basic yet important & useful [opsec](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/operations_security)/[netsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_security) resources):
## [Cover Your Tracks](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/)
* "Cover Your Tracks is two things: a tool for users to understand how unique and identifiable their browser makes them online, and a research project to uncover the tools and techniques of online trackers and test the efficacy of privacy add-ons."([from their about page](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/about))
