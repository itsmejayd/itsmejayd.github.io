This page is basically a directory of links.<!--more--> I have a hodgepodge of useful bookmarks accumulated over time in a yet-to-be-well-organized bookmark directory and I wanted to group up a few of them for specific topics (this page being for links related to some basic cybersec/infosec/netsec/opsec stuff). I figured I might as well post it here for my own reference and so others might get use from it! These links are in no particular order, though Iâ€™ll try to provide a brief description of what each one is here.

I might add a table of contents for these link dump pages at a later date because some of them are pretty long... but for now if anyone is reading this, command/crtl+f will have to suffice.

# Cyber Threat Maps:
## What is a cyber threat map?
* 'Cyberattack maps, also called cyber threat maps, are visual representations of real-time or historical cyberattacks on networks, devices and computer systems...Cyberattack maps leverage data analysis and visualization tools to provide insights into the nature and scope of cyber threats, such as:
    * Location
    * Frequency
    * Attack type
* Some visualization techniques include heat maps, graphs and timelines so that users understand the information more easily.'
[(paraphrased from splunk)](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/cyberattack-maps.html)

## [Digital Attack Map](https://www.digitalattackmap.com/#anim=1&color=0&country=ALL&list=0&time=18763&view=map)
* This one is my favorite, so cool.
* Provides a real-time visualization of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks worldwide.
* Shows data on the largest reported DDoS attacks, highlighting their sources and targets.
* Users can view specific details such as the duration, size, and type of attacks, and filter the data by various criteria, like country or attack type.

## [Check Point Cyber Threat Map](https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/)
* Provides a real-time visualization of cyberattacks worldwide.
* Displays data on the sources and targets of attacks, showing the volume and types of threats detected.
* The map is dynamic, with attacks represented as lines connecting the origin to the destination, providing insight into global cyber threat patterns.
