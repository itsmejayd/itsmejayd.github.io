This page is basically just a directory of links.<!--more--> I have a hodgepodge of useful bookmarks accumulated over time in a yet-to-be-well-organized bookmark directory and I wanted to group up a few of them for specific topics (this page being for links related to standards/frameworks/policy stuff). I figured I might as well post it here for my own reference and so others might get use from it! These links are in no particular order, though Iâ€™ll try to provide a brief description of what each one is here.

I might add a table of contents for these link dump pages at a later date because some of them are pretty long... but for now if anyone is reading this, command/crtl+f will have to suffice.

# NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology):
## What is NIST?
  * NIST is a U.S. federal agency that develops and promotes measurement standards, guidelines, and technologies to enhance innovation, industrial competitiveness, and public safety across various sectors, including cybersecurity, manufacturing, and technology.

## [NIST Frameworks](https://www.nist.gov/frameworks)
* these frameworks provide guidance for organizations to address cybersecurity, privacy, AI, and other risks through various frameworks, including the Cybersecurity Framework and Risk Management Framework.

## [NIST CSF (Cybersecurity Framework)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf)
* is a set of guidelines designed to help organizations of all types manage and reduce cybersecurity risks through improved governance, risk management, and communication strategies

# ISO (International Organization for Standardization):
## What is ISO?
* ISO is a global body that develops and publishes consensus-based standards to ensure interoperability, safety, and quality across diverse industries and sectors

## ISO 27001 (and ISO 27002)
* is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS) that provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

* 27001 vs 27002: "the controls in ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 are exactly the same; the only difference is that
ISO 27002 provides detailed guidance on how the controls could be implemented".([page 3](https://info.advisera.com/hubfs/27001Academy/27001Academy_FreeDownloads/Overview_of_New_Security_Controls_in_ISO_27002_EN.pdf))
* The most current edition of this standard is [available on the ISO site](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001), but it costs about $150 as of the writing of this article. This most current 3rd edition was published in 2022. I've tried finding pdfs of the current edition around online, no luck. I also tried using my alumni access to various publications to get access to this elusive document - I contacted my alumni association to be sure. No luck... But, there is more information available about the previous edition published in 2013, and some information about what is different (lots of overlap):

# PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard):
## What is PCI DSS?
* PCI DSS is a set of security standards designed to protect cardholder data and ensure secure payment processing by setting requirements for data security and risk management.
* [further details about PCI DSS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/PCI-DSS-Payment-Card-Industry-Data-Security-Standard#:~:text=PCI%20DSS%20was%20created%20in,Discover%2C%20JCB%20and%20American%20Express.)
