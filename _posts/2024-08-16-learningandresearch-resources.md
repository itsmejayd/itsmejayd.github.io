This page is basically a directory of links.<!--more--> I have a hodgepodge of useful bookmarks accumulated over time in a yet-to-be-well-organized bookmark directory and I wanted to group up a few of them for specific topics (this page being for links related to general learning and research resources). I figured I might as well post it here for my own reference and so others might get use from it! These links are in no particular order, though Iâ€™ll try to provide a brief description of what each one is here.

I might add a table of contents for these link dump pages at a later date because some of them are pretty long... but for now if anyone is reading this, command/crtl+f will have to suffice.

# Textbooks are expensive and so is [your] memory:
## [Library Genesis](https://libgen.is/)
* ***THIS IS A VALUABLE RESOURCE*** - Texts from this site can be used to great affect for college courses, technical certification prep, and more!
* Library Genesis (LibGen) is a free online repository offering millions of scientific articles, books, and academic resources across various disciplines.
* It operates in a legal grey area, providing access to copyrighted materials, often bypassing traditional paywalls.

## [openstax](https://openstax.org/)
* Similar to LibGen, the selection is less broad but more legal.
* OpenStax.org is a nonprofit educational initiative that offers free, peer-reviewed, openly licensed textbooks and resources for college and high school courses.

## Compare textbook prices:
* Websites to compare textbook prices for buying/selling/renting books.
    * [SlugBooks](https://www.slugbooks.com/)
    * [BookScouter](https://bookscouter.com/)

## [LitSolutions](https://www.litsolutions.org/)
 * Free step-by-step solutions to many textbook problems (seems to be many common college course texts)

## [spreeder](https://www.spreeder.com/app.php)
* ***NOTE:*** Another super useful tool here.
    * A little practice goes a long way.
    * Somewhat less useful for readings with high syntax/vocab complexity.
* Spreeder is a speed-reading tool.
* Displays text in a rapid, sequential manner.
* Supposed to enhance comprehension and retention by minimizing subvocalization and reducing eye movement.

## [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
* Anki is an open-source flashcard app.
* Memorize information efficiently through spaced repetition.
* Supports multimedia flashcards and is widely used for language learning, studying, and retaining complex information
