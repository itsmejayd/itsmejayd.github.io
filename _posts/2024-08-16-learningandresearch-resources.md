This page is basically a directory of links.<!--more--> I have a hodgepodge of useful bookmarks accumulated over time in a yet-to-be-well-organized bookmark directory and I wanted to group up a few of them for specific topics (this page being for links related to general learning and research resources). I figured I might as well post it here for my own reference and so others might get use from it! These links are in no particular order, though Iâ€™ll try to provide a brief description of what each one is here.

I might add a table of contents for these link dump pages at a later date because some of them are pretty long... but for now if anyone is reading this, command/crtl+f will have to suffice.

# Textbooks are expensive and so is your memory:
## [Library Genesis](https://libgen.is/)
* ***THIS IS A VALUABLE RESOURCE*** - Texts from this site can be used to great affect for college courses, technical certification prep, and more!
* Library Genesis (LibGen) is a free online repository offering millions of scientific articles, books, and academic resources across various disciplines.
* It operates in a legal grey area, providing access to copyrighted materials, often bypassing traditional paywalls.

## [openstax](https://openstax.org/)
* Similar to LibGen, but the selection is less broad but more legal.
* OpenStax.org is a nonprofit educational initiative that offers free, peer-reviewed, openly licensed textbooks and resources for college and high school courses.

## Compare textbook prices
* Websites to compare textbook prices for buying/selling/renting books.
    * [SlugBooks](https://www.slugbooks.com/)
    * [BookScouter](https://bookscouter.com/)

## [LitSolutions](https://www.litsolutions.org/)
 * Free step-by-step solutions to many textbook problems (seems to be many common college course texts)

## [spreeder](https://www.spreeder.com/app.php)
* Spreeder is a speed-reading tool.
* Displays text in a rapid, sequential manner.
* Supposed to enhance comprehension and retention by minimizing subvocalization and reducing eye movement.
* ***NOTE:***
    * Really cool to experience for the first time, give it a try on some article!
    * A little practice goes a long way.
    * Bonus tip: If the reading you want to speed through is already somewhat verbose/filled with extraneous information, consider having your favorite language model do a summary configured as you may. Then 'spreed' the summary to double the skim-rewards (but also the risks)!
    * Less useful for readings with high syntax/vocab complexity.

## [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
* Anki is an open-source flashcard app.
* Memorize information efficiently through spaced repetition.
* Supports multimedia flashcards and is widely used for language learning, studying, and retaining complex information

## At risk of being news to nobody
* [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
    * Extremely useful, large language model powered, chatbot.
* [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/)
    * WolframAlpha is a computational search engine that provides expert-level answers and solutions by analyzing queries through algorithms and curated data.
    * Fantastically helpful when doing various maths.
* Honorable mention: [Wolfram plugin for ChatGPT](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/03/chatgpt-gets-its-wolfram-superpowers/)

# Research Resources:

## [Internet Archive / Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/)
* This is an invaluable resource for doing many kinds of research on the web!
* From their [about page](https://archive.org/about/):
    * "The Internet Archive, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, is building a digital library of Internet sites and other cultural artifacts in digital form."
    * "...28+ years of web history accessible through the Wayback Machine..."
 * For developers, check out the [Wayback Machine APIs](https://archive.org/help/wayback_api.php)!

## [Map of reddit](https://anvaka.github.io/map-of-reddit/?x=18239&y=12514&z=29055.0602231602&v=2)

![screenshot of example usage](/assets/images/learningandresearch_images/mapex.png)

* An interactive visual map of reddit.
* Each dot on the map is subreddit. Two dots within the same cluster are usually close to each other if multiple users frequently leave comments on both subreddits.
* This thing is so cool, shoutout to Andrei.
* For more info, here is the project's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/anvaka/map-of-reddit?tab=readme-ov-file).

## [YouTube metadata search](https://filmot.com/)
* "Search within YouTube subtitles and captions"
* "Enclose phrases in double quotation marks, for example: "radio telescope" Indexing over 960 million captions across 870 million videos and 65 million channels."

## [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)
* OurWorldInData.org is an open-access, data-driven platform that provides research and visualizations on global development trends such as poverty, health, education, and climate change.
* It combines empirical data with expert analysis to help inform policy, promote understanding, and support decision-making on the world's most pressing issues.
