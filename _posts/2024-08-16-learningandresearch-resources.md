This page is basically a directory of links.<!--more--> I have a hodgepodge of useful bookmarks accumulated over time in a yet-to-be-well-organized bookmark directory and I wanted to group up a few of them for specific topics (this page being for links related to general learning and research resources). I figured I might as well post it here for my own reference and so others might get use from it! These links are in no particular order, though Iâ€™ll try to provide a brief description of what each one is here.

I might add a table of contents for these link dump pages at a later date because some of them are pretty long... but for now if anyone is reading this, command/crtl+f will have to suffice.
