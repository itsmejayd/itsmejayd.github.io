This page is basically a [directory](https://jackyan.com/blog/2023/09/bring-back-the-human-curated-web-directory/) of links.<!--more--> I have a hodgepodge of useful bookmarks accumulated over time in a yet-to-be-well-organized bookmark directory and I wanted to group up a few of them for specific topics (this page being for links related to smartphone stuff). I figured I might as well post it here for my own reference and so others might get use from it! These links are not necessarily in any particular order, but I will try to provide a brief description each.

## Android/other mobile devices:
This post is pretty "iOS-centric" since I have been mainly using an iPhone for years, but some of the iOS related links are largely overlapping or compatible with applicable info for Android and other mobile devices.
