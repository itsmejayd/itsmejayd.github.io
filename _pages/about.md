This is my personal website to showcase what I'm working on, thinking about, and finding interesting.

Here is my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/itsmejayd/itsmejayd.github.io) repo for this website.

The site is built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
